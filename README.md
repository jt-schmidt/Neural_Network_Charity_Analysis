# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Module 19 UT Data Visualization Bootcamp -- Neural Network Exploration using Python &amp; Jupyter Notebook

<!-- The purpose of this analysis is well defined (4 pt) -->
## Overview

Module 19 challenge assignment is broken in to 3 specific deliverables:
1.  Pre-process sample data set for use within a neural network model
  * Includes column value grouping based on uniqueness
2.  Compile, Train, and Evaluate Model using [Tensorflow Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras)
  * Includes initial determination of neuron count within hidden node layers
3.  Optimization of the Model with goal to achieve target predictive accuracy higher than 75%
  * This was exercise on exploring effects on model accuracy

Sample Data
* >34,000 organizations
* Variety of metadata for each organization
  * EIN and NAME—Identification columns
  * APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
  * AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
  * CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
  * USE_CASE—Use case for funding
  * ORGANIZATION—Organization type
  * STATUS—Active status
  * INCOME_AMT—Income classification
  * SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
  * ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
  * IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively
  
Resources used include:
  * Python in Jupyter Notebook
  * Tensorflow
  * Pandas
  * Sklearn

<!-- There is a bulleted list that answers all six questions (15 pt) -->
## Results

* Data Preprocessing
  
  1. What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

  2. What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

  3. What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  
  4. How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

  5. Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  
  6. What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?



<!-- Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. 
Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
